## Why?
Automating some of the tedium of organizing when we unlock a new puzzle can free up our energy for solving.

## What?
Miscellaneous bot and code for the Shower Pomelo MIT Mystery Hunt team.

Hopefully:
- Discordbot
- Google Sheets integration
- Hosted online somewhere
- Code repository for those puzzles that need it
- Knowledge repository

### Discordbot
- Ideally can give pingable roles (new puzzle, meta squad)
- Command for new puzzle creates google sheet, new channel, publishes link to sheet, pings @new puzzle in channel, and informs hub
- Command to list all solved/unsolved puzzles (keeps list? reads from shared folder?)
- Webhooks needed here?

### Google Sheets integration
- Host google account?
- Shared folder
- Make a copy of a template sheet, name it, put it in the applicable folder
- Extra: Rename sheet, put links to sheets places

### Hosted online somewhere
- Heroku? Have enough free dyno hours

### Code repository for those puzzles that need it
Commonly used functions (assuming python):
- CSV to Numpy array
- Alphabetic 1=A 26=Z encoding
- Basic anagrammer
- SAT solver
- Grid game model?
