# Notes from Left Out's How To Hunt Workshop
Compiled by Carly, December 2020

##**Recommendations for a Rapid Ramp Up, 1 hour**
- Watch skit
- Attempt to solve Again! (consult notes if needed)
- Watch the meta discussion (do not watch within the week of MH for recency bias)
- Skim these notes
- Give feedback on puzzle template

## Introduction to MITMH
They introduced their workshop with a short humorous skit between Smutty Henry (anagram for Mystery Hunt) and a boy, Jimmy.

MITMH starts at 12 noon ET, at a kickoff with a skit, which introduces the theme. Apparently MITMH was started in 1981 by a grad student who hid a rare penny somewhere on campus. There are puzzles, and scheduled events. Teams are anywhere from 2-200 (but we prefer 20-35).

## MITMH Puzzles
*lots of caveats to everything in this section*

General Properties:
- Not given ALL the instructions
- Answer is a simple word/phrase
- USE THE INTERNET!
- don't usually need source code
- generally 1st 3rd of hunt is easier

General Structure:
- Title
- Flavor text
- Puzzle content (data)

Questions to ask yourself:
- Does this reference a real-world thing?
- Is it MIT-specific?
- Does it have obvious starting hints/messages?
- How do I get an answer out of it?
- Have I used everything? (good puzzles have no extraneous data)

## Example Puzzle: Again!

Identify, Sort, Index, Solve common pattern of puzzles (more in the notes above)
- Sort: reorder the data. If there's an obvious sorting in the given order, it needs a resort.
- Index: into solved clue. Initialism trick - read the first letters, or at a diagonal
- Solve: don't need all clues to funish a puzzle, but if you enjoy it, continue!
- Solve: Often a recursive step, do the process of Identify again.

## Metapuzzles
- Use answers from previous puzzles
- Optionally thematic, provide closure and/or a milestone
- "boss battle" of puzzles
- usually signified as a meta by being different -- larger, bolded, etc
- High risk/reward
- 2 types: pure meta or shell meta
- Often a dad joke pun answer so you can't google it as easily

### Pure Meta Example: A Circus Line
[Puzzle](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2012/puzzles/a_circus_line/), [Solution](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2012/puzzles/a_circus_line/solution/)
- Only answers
- Can reorder by answer length
- Can match answers
- Ask: are the answer words used for their letters, or as synonyms/clues?

### Shell Meta Example: Scifi Island
[Puzzle](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2018/full/island/scifi.html), [Solution](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/2018/full/solution/starship_enterprise.html)
- Answers + extra stuff (grid, artwork, etc)

### Backsolving
Using the meta to figure out the answer to its feeder puzzles.  Can use:
- Lengths of words constrained by the meta
- Letters matching (used in the meta)
